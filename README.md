# Exercise

This is a small web app designed to house information about a company and its internal events. The objective is for you to fill in the analytics page so that admins can get a better sense of how many and which people are RSVPing to their events.

## Getting started

For this exercise, the backend is written in `Ruby` using the `Sinatra` framework. The frontend is written in `TypeScript` using `React`. You'll need to add code to both the backend and frontend to complete the analytics page.

First, ensure you have the prerequisite installed on your system: `ruby`, `bundler`, `libsqlite3`, `node`, and `yarn`. Then,

* Run `bin/setup` to install all package dependencies.
* Run `bundle exec rackup` to start the backend server.
* Run `yarn start` to start the frontend server.

## Development

Now that you're setup, you can start developing the analytics page. If you navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, you'll see the current app. You can then click on the Analytics link to see the shell of the page. There are three things that need to be filled in:

* Total number of events - this should be just a number inside the panel body
* Total number of RSVPs - this should be just a number inside the panel body, it should only include active users in its count
* RSVPs by department - this should be a list of the departments in the system, along with the number of RSVPs for each department. Only include active users in the counts of RSVPs, and only include departments that have active users.

Feel free to use any components from our [component library](https://github.com/CultureHQ/components) (you can see them layed out [here](https://engineering.culturehq.com/components)). Any styling that you deem necessary can be added to `styles.css`. No additional packages or gems should be added to this application.

It can be helpful to have access to a `Ruby` console throughout development in case you need to inspect the data types. For this you can run `bin/console` and it will open up a console with everything already loaded.

## Submitting

Once development is done, make sure you code passes the code style checks and tests in the repository with `bin/test`. You can check out the individual steps in that script if anything fails. Be sure that you have tests to cover the code you've added.

Then, please email us a copy of a patch file that contains your changes. You can obtain one by staging all the files that you've changed in git and then running `git diff` and sending us the output.

```
git add .
git diff > my_changes.patch
```
